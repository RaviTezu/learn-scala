- You can pass zero or more strings("Hello","world!") i.e varialbe length arguments to a function by having (strings:String*) as its parameter. Ex: arguments/Take_a_sequence_of_strings.scala
- To make scala script into a compiled, command-line tool. Use main method inside a object. It is like static main method in a class(in Java).
- for(x <- y) - "<-" can be used when you're iterating or extracting the info. i.e y can be [Some("a"),Some("b"),None] and <- will ignore the None values. 
- Call-by-name enables us to build our own control structures. - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13337338/call-by-name-vs-call-by-value-in-scala-clarification-needed
- A related scenario to by-name parameters is the case where you want to evaluate an expression once to initialize a value, not repeatedly, but you want to defer that invocation.
